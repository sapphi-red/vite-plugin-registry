# About

This registry collects plugin data from npm daily and provides a searchable directory of plugins for the JavaScript bundler ecosystem.

The data is refreshed every day automatically based on the data from npm and metadata provided by plugin authors.

## For Plugin Authors

Plugin authors can provide enhanced metadata by adding a `vite-plugin-registry` field to their `package.json`. See the [Guide](/guide/) for details.

## Credits

This registry is partially inspired by [Flint's blog post "What Flint Does Differently"](https://www.flint.fyi/blog/what-flint-does-differently/#plugin-registry).
